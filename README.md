# FirstPersonShooter

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

In this game you controll a shooter character and are able to shoot a riffle and kill the AI enemy drones.

## How the game works

- the player can controll a character that can move around and shoot a riffle;
- kill all the enemimy drones to win the game;
- winning the game you get the message "You Win!";
- if your helth gets to 0 your character dies and you lose;
- if the player dies you get the message "You died!";
- the AI bots will chase and explode once it gets close enough to the player causing damage;
- if the time runs out you lose and a message pops up "Out of time";
- you can pick up ammo to refil ammo;
- you can pick up health to restore health;
